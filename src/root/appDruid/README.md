# appDruid

Again, another victim of _entropy._ I just found the .apk on my phone (Among others, grep almighty..) and thought that it was silly enough (Although, not a script?). 

All 10 lines were written in [_**Kotlin.**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_Island)

![as](https://github.com/KayserSoze42/extend.io/blob/main/src/root/appDruid/demo.png?raw=true)

The computer it was written on, is also a [funny story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) so .apks is all I have.

I am uploading the unsigned [.apk](https://github.com/KayserSoze42/extend.io/releases/tag/0.0.1-app-druid) file, and creating this README.md as a silly entry and a lesson for otters.
