### C-mo

_Tampermonkey script to "broaden the horizons", wink wink._

_To quote from the gospels of one Omar Devone Little:_ 

    Hate the game, not the wannabe modder.

_This is one of those files that I feel somewhat confident with sharing, and yet again feel scared for the implications._

_Bitter-sweet stuff._

_It's one of the "cooler" JavaScript thingies I still have, so here you have it too._

#### Origins

_The only thing I wish to ask, is for You to keep an open mind. In my experience, context matters much and the devil is in the details._

_There was/is a [[REDACTED]] place for [[REDACTED]] stuff. In my defence, I wasn't familiar with it until I was "hired" for this spaghetti._

_Although holding a great collection, certain users wished for some additional functionality on the webpage._

_I was asked by one of the users if I could contribute to the problem. Or solution. I don't remember._

_It started like this: Can you make the comments show on the results page so we don't have to jump around the info, just to get to a comment with something important?_

_That was quickly followed with: Well, can you make the info toggleable, hidden by default, and we'll choose if we need to see it or not._

_And the end: But we still want to see the info. On the results page. When we hover over the results._

_It is still in a working condition \*slaps regex\*, just as the day I wrote it, and I was offerred pictures to present alongside the code._

_The name is a play on BMO from Adventure Time, and this was a point I started straying away from JavaScript._
