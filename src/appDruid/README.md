_You are now a developer!_

Again, victim of _entropy._ I just found the .apk on my phone (among others, grep almighty..) and thought that it was silly enough.

The computer it was written, is also a [funny story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) so .apks is all I have.

I am uploading the unsigned .apk file, and creating this README.md as a silly entry and a lesson for otters.
