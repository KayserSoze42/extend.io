# theOzone 

I'm done. I lost so many fun stuff, but have a bunch of ozone algores spread around.

Still it's a pretty _ctrl+cilly_ [one](https://github.com/KayserSoze42/extend.io/blob/main/src/neveroddoreven/theOzone/theOzone.py).

As I see it, it is just another version of the ozone idea, but this time going CLI..

\+__**pyperclip**__ for a fast and furious conversion..
